# React + Vite

Exciting news! It's my first React Three Project!

I'm thrilled to share my latest portfolio webpage created using React Three Fiber Drei helper useScroll with GSAP. It's been an incredible experience using Three.js to build 3D elements in the web page. I encourage you to check it out and play with it yourself! A big thank you to Thais for providing the 3D model and Wassim SAMAD for the invaluable teaching video.
